            "Question": "How does a backlog, debar, de-registration and grade back affect one's SGPA and CGPA as a whole ?",
            "Category": "Academics",
            "Answer": "Backlog is described as that scenario when a student fails a particular subject because of poor performance. The student must then repeat the subject either in the following summer (with no grade back) or take up the course next year with his/her juniors (with a grade back i.e the max grade he would be securing would be A)\r\nDebar is described as that scenario when a student gets removed from the course due to attendance or any other personal issue. He/she then has to repeat the course in any other semester and also need not attend classes in that semester.\r\nDeregister is described by that scenario where he/she simply removes his registration from that course and pursues it in a later semester. The SGPA/CGPA won’t be affected in any way because the student would anyway complete the course before graduating at some point of time.\r\nGrade back is defined as that scenario when the student gets his/her grade subtracted by one level before even appearing for it. The possible reasons maybe attendance. If he/she fails to maintain the min 75% for a course in a semester (Max 8 absents for 4 credit courses,  6 absents for 3 credit courses and 4 absents for 2 credit courses), he/she would then get a grade back. So the max possible grade which can be secured would be A and not EX.\r\n"

            "Category": "Academics, Administration, Departments, General Awareness",
            "Answer": "As per the Academic Regulations \r\n(Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1le3h9A7CZcCAGScwAxRrMxrKJD5Kfmq1 ) the main features are as follows:-\r\n\r\n•\tThe duration of the course leading to B.Tech. Degree will ordinarily be four years. A student may, however, opt for the slow pace programme if he does not feel comfortable with the work load. Under certain cases, e.g., poor grades, he is required to proceed in slow pace to minimize the time required to complete the programme. If a student gets a CGPA less than 6.00 in three consecutive semesters, he must leave the Institute. Therefore, it is in a student’s interest to estimate his own capability and register under a slow pace mode from third semester onwards, or even from the First semester. The criterion for slow pace is:\r\n\r\n•\tIt is necessary for a student to maintain a CGPA equal to or above 6.00 at all times. If the CGPA falls below 6.00 he should enter a slow pace programme in his own interest. The following procedure will be used to make “slow pace” mandatory for a student with poor performance. A modified grade point average called MGPA will be computed by replacing all F and X grades by P grades. If the MGPA equals or exceeds 6.00, he may be permitted to register for a full suite of higher semester courses at the discretion of Faculty Advisor. If the MGPA remains below 6.00 the student must enter a slow pace programme. To register in higher semester in slow pace, the number of courses being decided by Faculty Advisor. To leave the Institute if CGPA falls below 6.00 in three consecutive semesters.\r\n\r\n•\tYear back means the student has to get readmitted to the corresponding year and repeat the academic courses again and the criterion is as follows :\r\n\r\n•\tIn case of a First Year student, if the CGPA is between 5.00 and 5.69, he will re-register in the First Semester and start the programme afresh. The CGPA in the repeat year must exceed 6.00, else the student has to leave the Institute.\r\n"

Mahapatra who answered a similar question “No, there is no such system. It might be needed specifically for a particular student for some specific journal, but that’s not the general case. As per my knowledge, the students along with their supervisors can publish their publications and there has not been any hassle so far. Usually, if a student is taking help from a particular organization or getting sponsorship only then, in that case, it is their moral responsibility to mention the name of that organization in the acknowledgment section stating that they could successfully complete the publication because of the help of that organization. However, if this question is exclusively meant for a specific student and that has to be treated individually.” \r\n"
